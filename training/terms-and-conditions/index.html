In addition, Provider may assign this Agreement to a subsidiary entity without written consent of Customer. Provider may subcontract all or any part of its obligations under this Agreement but shall remain responsible for the acts and omissions of its subcontractors as though they were acts of Provider itself. Except as specifically provided herein, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement shall benefit or create any right on behalf of any person or entity other than Customer and Provider.</p>
<p>17.2. Waiver. The failure of either Party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or a waiver of the right of such Party to thereafter enforce each and every provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>17.3. Severability. If a particular provision of this Agreement is terminated or held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent legally permissible and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>17.4. Headings. The headings or titles preceding the text of the sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted solely for convenience of reference, and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement, nor shall they affect the meaning, construction or effect of this Agreement.</p>

<p>17.6. Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable to the extent that its performance of this Agreement is prevented, or rendered so difficult or expensive as to be commercially impracticable, by reason of an Act of God, labor dispute, unavailability of transportation, goods or services, governmental restrictions or actions, war (declared or undeclared) or other hostilities, pandemic, or by any other event, condition or cause which is not foreseeable on the Effective Date and is beyond the reasonable control of the Party, provided that such Party promptly informs the other Party of such event, and makes diligent efforts to work around the event and resume performance. In the event of non-performance or delay in performance attributable to any such causes, the period allowed for performance of the applicable obligation under this Agreement will be extended for a period equal to the period of the delay.</p>
<p>17.7. Customer PO to Facilitate Payment Only. The Parties agree that any PO submitted by a Customer to Provider is for facilitating invoicing and payment only. Any additional, inconsistent, or different terms included in a Customer PO or other documents (including electronic) submitted to Provider by or on behalf of Customer at any time, whether before or after the Effective Date are hereby expressly rejected by Provider and of no effect. These terms and conditions shall be deemed accepted by Customer without any such additional, inconsistent, or different terms and conditions, except to the extent expressly accepted by Provider in writing and signed by Provider.</p>
<p>17.8. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and all appendices attached hereto (which are specifically incorporated herein by this reference) contain the full and entire agreement between the Parties. It supersedes all prior negotiations, and proposals, written or otherwise, relating to its subject matter. Any modifications, revisions or amendments to this Agreement must be set forth in writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.</p>
<p>Counterparts.
